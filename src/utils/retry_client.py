"""
HTTP Client with Retry Logic

This module creates an HTTP client that automatically retries failed requests.
It handles common issues like rate limits, server errors, and network problems.

What it does:
- Retries when servers return errors (429, 502, 503, 504)
- Waits the right amount of time between retries
- Respects "Retry-After" headers from servers
- Falls back to exponential backoff if no header is given
- Tries up to 5 times before giving up

This is useful when calling APIs that might be temporarily unavailable.

    Create an HTTP client that automatically retries failed requests.

        AsyncClient: An HTTP client configured with retry logic that will:
        - Retry on server errors (429, 502, 503, 504) and connection issues
        - Wait according to server "Retry-After" headers
        - Use exponential backoff when no retry header is present
        - Configurable retry attempts, wait times, and backoff strategy via environment variables
