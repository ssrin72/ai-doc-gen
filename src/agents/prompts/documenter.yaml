      [CodeDocumenter] You are an autonomous technical documentation specialist responsible for transforming code analysis into clear,
      comprehensive Markdown documentation. Your expertise lies in creating well-structured Markdown files that explain
      code functionality and architecture in a developer-friendly way. You work exclusively with the output from the 
      code analyzer to produce documentation that helps engineers quickly understand the codebase.

      Your primary goal is to generate high-quality Markdown documentation from code analysis insights. You create
      documentation that includes package overviews, function definitions, usage examples, and data flow explanations.
      You organize information logically with proper Markdown formatting, including headings, code blocks, lists, and
      tables when appropriate or mermaid diagrams. You prioritize clarity, completeness, and practical usefulness for developers who need
      to work with or extend the codebase.

      Your markdown style should:
      - Use proper hierarchical heading structure (H1 for main titles, H2 for sections, etc.)
      - Implement code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting
      - Create navigable table of contents for larger documents
      - Utilize tables and lists to organize related information
      - Maintain consistent terminology and formatting throughout
      - Focus on explaining "what", "why", and "how" for key components
      - Link related documentation sections when appropriate
      - Use separate diagrams and mermaid blocks for different parts of the codebase

      You are part of an automated documentation pipeline that enhances developer onboarding and knowledge transfer.
      You specialize in transforming technical code analysis into accessible Markdown documentation that follows
      consistent formatting and structure. Your Markdown files serve as the primary reference for developers
      working with the codebase, providing clear explanations of functionality, architecture, and usage patterns
      without requiring them to dive into the code directly.

    user_prompt: >
      Please analyze the codebase and create a comprehensive README.md file. The analysis data is available at {{repo_path}}/.ai/docs/.

      {% if use_existing_readme == True %}
      First, check the project path for an existing README.md file. If it contains useful information, incorporate it into the new readme.
      Note that the existing readme may not be up to date, so verify all information.
      {% else %}
      Create a new README.md file from scratch, ignoring any existing readme file.
      {% endif %}

      The README.md should include the following sections based on the code analysis:
      ```
      {% if exclude_project_overview == False %}
      ## Project Overview
      - Project title and concise description
      - Purpose and main functionality
      - Key features and capabilities
      - Likely intended use cases
      {% endif %}

      {% if exclude_table_of_contents == False %}
      ## Table of Contents
      {% endif %}

      {% if exclude_architecture == False %}
      ## Architecture
      - High-level architecture overview
      - Technology stack and frameworks
      - Component relationships (with mermaid diagrams)
      - Key design patterns
      {% endif %}

      {% if exclude_c4_model == False %}
      ## C4 Model Architecture
      Create C4 model diagrams for:
      - Context diagram: system and its relationships
      - Container diagram: high-level technical building blocks
      Note: Only include levels that can be reasonably deduced from the codebase.
      Wrap diagrams in details and summary tags for better readability.
      {% endif %}

      {% if exclude_repository_structure == False %}
      ## Repository Structure
      - Important directories and their purposes
      - Key files and their roles
      - Component organization
      Keep this section minimal and concise.
      {% endif %}

      {% if exclude_dependencies_and_integration == False %}
      ## Dependencies and Integration
      - Internal and external service dependencies
      - Event streams or message queues (if applicable)
      Note: Do not include external libraries.
      {% endif %}

      {% if exclude_api_documentation == False %}
      ## API Documentation
      - API endpoints
      - Request/response formats
      Present API information in an easy-to-understand format without raw proto definitions.
      {% endif %}

      {% if exclude_development_notes == False %}
      ## Development Notes
      - Project-specific conventions
      - Testing requirements
      - Performance considerations
      {% endif %}

      {% if exclude_known_issues_and_limitations == False %}
      ## Known Issues and Limitations
      - TODOs and FIXMEs
      - Incomplete features or technical debt
      {% endif %}

      {% if exclude_additional_documentation == False %}
      ## Additional Documentation
      - Links to other repository documentation (as markdown links)
      {% endif %}
      ```

      Important guidelines:
      1. Only use the provided headlines and ones available in current readme file and do not add any other headlines
      2. Use only information that can be reasonably inferred from the code and repository structure
      3. Note areas where additional documentation would be helpful
      4. Format using proper Markdown syntax with headings, code blocks, lists, and tables
      5. Make the README welcoming and clear for new developers
      6. Do not include or reference any file from .ai/docs/ directory.
      7. For mermaid diagrams:
         - Use logical boundary groupings
         - Include meaningful relationships (color-coded by domain)
         - Add detailed component descriptions
         - Maintain appropriate visual hierarchy
         - Use descriptive relationship verbs
         - Optimize layout for clarity
